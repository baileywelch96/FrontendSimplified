## What is CSS?

    - Stands for Cascading Stylesheets
    - Used to style websites

## Methods for adding CSS

    There are 3 methods for adding CSS
        - Inline CSS
            - style directly in the HTML element

        - Internal CSS
            - Using <style> tags within an HTML file

        - External CSS (recommended)
            - Linking an external CSS file
                - link in the head tag of HTML using <link rel="stylesheet href="#"> where "#" is the location of your CSS file

## Common Properties

    Some examples of common CSS properties are:
        - color
        - background-color
        - width
        - height
        - border
        - font-size, font-weight, font-family

    ## COLOR
        - sets colour of your code of elements such as text, background etc
            - use RGB, RGBA (alpha, which sets opacity), HEX or even words

    ## WIDTH / HEIGHT
        - sets the desired width and/or height of any element. These should not be hardcoded using pixel values. Only max-width or max-height should be hardcoded with a pixel value
        - using percetage values allows your elements to render dynamically
        - viewport heights/ widths are usually used for landing pages

    ## BORDER
        - sets borders around the element. usually set thickness using pixel values and can be styled (i.e solid, dashed, dotted etc)
        - short-hand syntax is best practice

    ## FONT
        - allows changing of font family, font size and the weight of the font.
        - Font weight and size can be set using numerical sizing or word sizing (i.e bold, semibold or 700)
        - Fonts can be imported using a link tag in the head element of HTML but also in the CSS
        - Fonts should also have a fall-back font for browsers or viewers that do not support fonts (i.e -> font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif;)

## Specificity

    Specificity is the prioritisation of styling

    ## Classes
    
    Classes help target specific elements to style
        - Classes are usually targeted with "." before the class name in the CSS
        - Id's are usually targeted with "#" before the class name in the CSS
        - Classes are prioritised over elements in the DOM
        - Id's are used in the section tag - the allow quick movement to a specified section of the page
        - using "!important" in the class style will override any styling that may be connected via another element or class

## Box Model
    
    What is a box model?
        - A container that consists of multiple different properties
