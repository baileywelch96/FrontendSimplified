## What is HTML?
    - Hyper Text Markup Language
    - It is NOT a programming language
    - It is used to create webpages and documents

## Tools/extensions required
    - VSCode or other code editor
    - Live Server extension
    - Prettier extension

## Tag Syntax
    How do we write HTML Tags?

    - Element names are surrounded by angle brackets // <div> </div> //
    - Tag elements usually come in pairs (start and end tag)
    - Some tags close themselves
        - Examples:
            - <h1>Frontend Simplified </h1>
            - <br /> (self closing tag)
            - <br> (this element is fine with HTML5)

## Level Elements
    Inline vs Block
        - Block elements start on a new line and take the full width available
        - Inline elements do not start on a new line and take only the necessary width
            - BLOCK: <div>, <h1>, <p>
            - INLINE: <span>, <a>, <button>

## Anchor tags
    Link to another URL or page
        - target="_blank" will allow the link to open in a new tab

## Lists
    UL - Unordered List
    LI - List Item
    OL - Ordered List (rarely implemented)

# Images
    src="" - source
        - src is where you tell the code to look for the image. Can be internal or a URL
        - alt is what displays if a device etc does not display an image. It is usually a description of what the image is
        - accessing folders inside or below current directory is done by using "./", going up a level is done by using "../"
